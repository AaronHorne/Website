                <p>I was born on February 3rd, 1995 in Farmington, New Mexico. Shortly after my birth, my family moved to Arkansas where I lived until I graduated highschool.
                    I joined the military in 2014 and was honorably discharged in 2018. Since then, I have married, had two kids (Everly and Sage), and been enrolled in Arkansas
                    Tech University.

                <h1 style="font-size: 2em;">Family</h1>
                <p>I married my wife on June 22nd, 2018. We waited a whole 72 days before getting pregnant with my first, Everly. She was born on March 11th, 2019 and was classified as
                    a micro-preemie. We stayed in the hospital with her for 108 days and now she is 3 years old and perfect. My second was born on December 14th, 2021 and was, thankfully,
                    a full-term, healthy baby. </p>
